# 5e D&D Random Character Generator

This is a random character generator for D&D 5e written in python. There has been some logic implemented in order to create characters according to trends noted in races/classes.


## Usage
Run main.py and it will create a random character object, with all necessary mechanical attributes of a 5e D&D character, and print it to the command line. I hope to bring functionality that will allow for selecting attributes and randomizing parts of a character. Some biases from the Player's Handbook, such as alignment, are incorporated and comments indicate when this has been taken into account. Some attributes, such as speed and skill modifiers, have not yet been used after being generated. Planning on creating a gui to feed out character information in a cleaner form.
